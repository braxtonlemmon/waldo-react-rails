# Find Waldo and His Friends
Project based on The Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/where-s-waldo-a-photo-tagging-app). The user must search the image on the screen for five characters. Once all are found, the user can enter a name and submit their name to the list of top scores. The goal of the project was to build an application with Ruby on Rails as the backend. I chose to use React to build the frontend.

# Learning objectives
- Create an application with React (using create-react-app) as the frontend and Ruby on Rails as a backend api.
- Deploy an app to Heroku that has separate frontend/backend components.
- Use the fetch api to connect React to the database.
- Practice using PostgreSQL in a rails project.
- Implement ThemeProvider in React for the styled components.
